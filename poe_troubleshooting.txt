‚úÖ Summary of Fixes Applied
üîß 1. Installed pavucontrol
Allowed you to raise the game‚Äôs volume, which was muted by default.
Used it to monitor and adjust game audio routing via the Playback and Output Devices tabs.
    sudo apt install pavucontrol


üõ† 2. Created a PipeWire Config Override to Set Sample Rate and Buffer Size
Created the file:

echo "context.properties = {
    default.clock.rate          = 48000
    default.clock.allowed-rates = [ 48000 44100 ]
    default.clock.quantum       = 1024
    default.clock.min-quantum   = 1024
    default.clock.max-quantum   = 1024
}" > ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/99-buffer.conf

Effect: Standardized the sample rate and set a stable buffer size (quantum) to eliminate audio distortion and timing issues.


üîÅ 3. Restarted PipeWire After Config Changes
    systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse


üîÑ 4. Restarted the Game After PipeWire Restart
Since audio connections are initialized at launch, restarting the game was necessary for changes to take effect.

Error: "Out-of-range adapter index" on startup of Path of Exile.

alt 1: 
In Steam:
Right-click Path of Exile (in the left pane of Library) ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Compatibility.
Enable ‚ÄúForce the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool‚Äù.
Try different versions. (This time Hotfix and experimental resulted in same error, but 9.0-4 worked).


alt 2:
Cause: Purging and re-installing a later version of Nvidia drivers.

This resets PoE‚Äôs Wine prefix ‚Äî it will regenerate the next time you launch it via Steam. (Don‚Äôt worry, this doesn‚Äôt delete the game itself.)
rm -rf /home/alpha/snap/steam/common/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/238960

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Upgrade Proton GE via ProtonUp-Qt
Sometimes crashes and rendering issues are fixed in later GE versions.

1. Install Flatpak (if not installed)
sudo apt install flatpak
2
. Add Flathub (only if it's not added already)
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

3. Install ProtonUp-Qt
flatpak install flathub net.davidotek.pupgui2

4. Run ProtonUp-Qt
flatpak run net.davidotek.pupgui2


Install the latest version (e.g., Proton-GE 9.5, if available)

In Steam ‚Üí PoE ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Compatibility ‚Üí select that version
Then launch again and test. If things improve, stick with it.

2. Try Different Proton Versions
Not all Proton versions behave the same:

Try Proton 8.x (official) if GE 9.x is buggy.

Proton Experimental may offer newer DXVK/VKD3D but can be less stable for PoE.

Some users report best stability with Proton GE 8-27 or GE 8-25 for Path of Exile.

To install older GE versions:

Open ProtonUp-Qt

Click "Add version"

Choose Proton-GE 8-27 or another from the dropdown.


3. Enable Esync + Fsync (if supported)
In Steam Launch Options for PoE, add:

PROTON_NO_ESYNC=0 PROTON_NO_FSYNC=0 %command%
These improve performance and may reduce stuttering or crashes (assuming your kernel supports it ‚Äî most Ubuntu 22.04+ setups with systemd do).


4. Tweak Vulkan Settings / DXVK HUD for Debugging
To debug rendering issues:

DXVK_HUD=1 %command%
This shows a small overlay with DXVK/Vulkan stats in the corner. You can watch FPS, GPU usage, and frame times while rendering bugs happen.


5. Switch Rendering Backend In-Game
Once in the game:

Open Options ‚Üí Graphics
Set Renderer to DirectX11 instead of Vulkan
Even though it‚Äôs "Windows-style", DX11 via DXVK often works better than Vulkan in Wine/Proton for some PoE builds.

6. Clean Shader Cache (Optional)
Sometimes bad shader cache causes rendering bugs. Clear it:

rm -rf ~/.steam/steamapps/shadercache/238960

üîπ 2. Download Proton-GE
Go to the official page:
üëâ https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases

Download a version known to work well with PoE, like:

Proton-GE-Proton8-27.tar.gz (stable) (I downloaded 8-28)

Or try latest: Proton-GE-Proton10-3.tar.gz

Download it to your ~/Downloads folder.


üîπ 3. Extract It to the Correct Location
Assuming you downloaded Proton-GE-Proton8-28.tar.gz, run:

tar -xvf ~/Downloads/Proton-GE-Proton9-5.tar.gz -C ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/
This will create a folder like:

~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/Proton-GE-Proton9-5/


üîπ4. Restart Steam
Close and reopen Steam.

üîπ 5. Use the New Proton-GE in Steam
Go to Path of Exile ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Compatibility
Enable: ‚ÄúForce the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool‚Äù
Select: Proton-GE-Proton9-5 (or whatever version you installed)
