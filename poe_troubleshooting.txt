✅ Summary of Fixes Applied
🔧 1. Installed pavucontrol
Allowed you to raise the game’s volume, which was muted by default.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install pavucontrol
Used it to monitor and adjust game audio routing via the Playback and Output Devices tabs.


🛠 2. Created a PipeWire Config Override to Set Sample Rate and Buffer Size
Created the file:

~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/99-buffer.conf
With these contents:

context.properties = {
    default.clock.rate          = 48000
    default.clock.allowed-rates = [ 48000 44100 ]
    default.clock.quantum       = 1024
    default.clock.min-quantum   = 1024
    default.clock.max-quantum   = 1024
}

Effect: Standardized the sample rate and set a stable buffer size (quantum) to eliminate audio distortion and timing issues.

🔁 3. Restarted PipeWire After Config Changes

systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse

🔄 4. Restarted the Game After PipeWire Restart
Since audio connections are initialized at launch, restarting the game was necessary for changes to take effect.

Error: "Out-of-range adapter index" on startup of Path of Exile.

alt 1: 
In Steam:
Right-click Path of Exile (in the left pane of Library) → Properties → Compatibility.
Enable “Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool”.
Try different versions. (This time Hotfix and experimental resulted in same error, but 9.0-4 worked).


alt 2:
Cause: Purging and re-installing a later version of Nvidia drivers.

This resets PoE’s Wine prefix — it will regenerate the next time you launch it via Steam. (Don’t worry, this doesn’t delete the game itself.)
rm -rf /home/alpha/snap/steam/common/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/238960
