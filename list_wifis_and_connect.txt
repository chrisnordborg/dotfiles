1. List available Wi-Fi networks
nmcli device wifi list
This shows nearby Wi-Fi networks, including SSIDs, signal strength, and security type.


2. Connect to a Wi-Fi network
nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" password "<password>"

Replace <SSID> with the name of the Wi-Fi network and <password> with the correct password. For example:
nmcli device wifi connect "HomeWiFi" password "mypassword123"
If the connection is successful, it will auto-connect next time.


3. Check your network connection
nmcli connection show --active
This will display your active network connections.


4. If unsure which Wi-Fi interface to use
nmcli device status
This will show devices like wlan0, wlp3s0, etc., and their statuses.

Optional: Manually specify interface (if needed)
nmcli device wifi connect "<SSID>" password "<password>" ifname <interface>
Replace <interface> with your Wi-Fi device name (like wlp3s0).
