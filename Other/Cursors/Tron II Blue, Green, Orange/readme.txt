Author's decription:

The revised version of the TRON cursor set.  The graphics are much sharper looking and the colors that I used more closely resemble those used in the movie TRON Legacy.  Sorry I was so late getting them out.

You may recolor them if you want to for yourself, but I do ask that you do not upload them as your own.

Please rate and comment!

Thanks, and enjoy!
