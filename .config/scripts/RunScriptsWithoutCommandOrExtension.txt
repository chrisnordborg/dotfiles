How do I run a shell script without using "sh" or "bash" commands?

I have a shell script which I want to run without using the "sh" or "bash" commands. For example:

Instead of: sh script.sh
I want to use: script.sh

How can I do this?
P.S. (i) I don't use shell script much and I tried reading about aliases, but I did not understand how to use them.

(ii) I also read about linking the script with another file in the PATH variables. I am using my university server and I don't have permissions to create a file in those locations.
----------------------------------------------------------
Add a "shebang" at the top of your file:

#!/bin/bash
And make your file executable (chmod +x script.sh).

Finally, modify your path to add the directory where your script is located:

export PATH=$PATH:/appropriate/directory
(typically, you want $HOME/bin for storing your own scripts)

----------------------------------------------------------
These are the prerequisites of directly using the script name:

Add the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) at the very top.
Use chmod u+x scriptname to make the script executable (where scriptname is the name of your script).
Place the script under /usr/local/bin folder.
Note: I suggest placing it under /usr/local/bin because most likely that path will be already added to your PATH variable.
Run the script using just its name, scriptname.
If you don't have access to /usr/local/bin then do the following:

Create a folder in your home directory and call it bin.

Do ls -lA on your home directory, to identify the start-up script your shell is using. It should be either .profile or .bashrc.

Once you have identified the start up script, add the following line:

PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
Once added, source your start-up script or log out and log back in.

To source, put . followed by a space and then your start-up script name, e.g. . .profile or . .bashrc

Run the script using just its name, scriptname.
